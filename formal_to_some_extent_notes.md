## Overview of formal linguistics

- Formal (to some extent, so not as a binary notion) linguistics VS ambiguous, non-formal natural language -> “levels of formalness”
- Pioneer: __Noam Chomsky__ (mid 50s)
  - Syntactic structures (using mathematical tools in language analysis)
  - Chomsky hierarchy
- Precursors: 
  - Panini
  - Greek philosophers
  - XIX century: historical perspective, diachronic, Hermann Paul -> sentences are the sum of their parts (compositionality, not quite true but useful)
  - XX century: Saussure -> Synchronic (,,,)
- Methods:
  - _corpus_ linguistics
  - formal analysis
  - experimental methods (a wide variety of them)
  - ethno-methodology (= conversation analysis, i.e. just observe language in context, used in anthropology)
- Computational linguistics (very close to language technology, which is more practical -> speech recognition/detection and so on) uses mathematical models that can be implemented

## Subfields of linguistics

- Phonetics
  - articulatory -> IPA chart (phonetic alphabet)
  - acoustic -> physics side of things
- Phonology -> phonemes, phonological rules
- Morphology (no clear boundary with syntax, cf. compounding)
  - inflectional: different forms in a paradigm, singular VS plural, feminine vs masculine…
  - derivational: how to create new words from existing ones (possibily in another category)
- Grammar -> (formally expressed) grammar rules (if we assume that natural languages are context free)
- Semantics -> uses propositiona & first order logic (yay!), model theory () & inference (formally & pragmatically)
- pragmatics = language in use: difference btw what we say & what we communicate (<), dynamic meaning
- lexicon (= list of words) -> words, but also phrases sometimes (idioms)

Secondary fields:

- hystorical l
- comparative l and l typology
- (…)

## Parts of speech

> noun, verb, adjective… : types = sentence, sintagm… : composition type (similr to types & function types?)

## Language universals

Languages differ, but only to some extent:

- real universals
- statistical universal

“Everyone” can speak

- native speakers -> difficult definition! (keywords may be: subconscious, kid)
