# Introduction to Formal Linguistics

FL is only formal to some extent - not as a binary notion. This is due to the fact that the object of study is natural language, which is ambiguous. One must always take into account the fact that there are, then, different "levels of formality”.

## Timeline
Precursors: 

- Pāṇini (Sanskrit philologist, IV century BCE)
- various Greek philosophers
- XIX century: 
  - historical & diachronic perspective
  - Hermann Paul: compositionality (sentences are the sum of their parts, not quite true but useful)
  - XX century: Ferdinand de Saussure 
- pioneer: __Noam Chomsky__ (mid 50s) - principal contributions:
  - Syntactic structures (using mathematical tools in language analysis)
  - Chomsky hierarchy
  
## Methodologies

- _Corpus_ linguistics, i.e. study of language as expressed in _corpora_ of "real world" text. If collected in natural context (_realia_), effectiveness improves
- formal analysis
- experimental methods (a wide variety)
- ethno-methodology aka conversation analysis, i.e. just observe language in context, used in anthropology

## Subfields

Main subfields:

- **Phonetics** (deals with the _production of speech sounds_)
  - articulatory - IPA chart (phonetic alphabet)
  - acoustic (physics side of things)
- **phonology** (is about _patterns of sounds conveying a meaning_): phonemes, phonological rules
- **morphology**: the study of the different forms words have, the boundary with syntax is not clear (cf. compounding in German and Swedish)
  - inflectional: about different forms in a paradigm, singular VS plural, feminine vs masculine...
  - derivational: about how to create new words from existing ones (possibly in another category, e.g. nouns from adjectives)
- **syntax**: set of (formally expressed, assuming that natural language is context free) structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases and words
- **semantics**: the study of meaning. It makes use of propositional & first order logic, model theory (somehow closely related to set theory) and inference (formal and pragmatic, i.e. common sense inference)
- **pragmatics**: study of language _in use_ (difference between what we say & what we communicate, dynamic meaning)
- **lexicon**: inventories of words (+ idioms)

Secondary subfields:

- historical linguistics
- comparative linguistics & typology
- (...)

Note that, according to most literature, syntax + morphology = grammar. 

## The origins of language

There is a lot of speculation on the origin of language (but not a definitive explanation)

Possible sources:

- __divine__ (cf. Genesis & Hindu traditions): this hypothesis led to numerous vain attempts to rediscover the (only) original divine language (before Babel)
- __natural sounds__:
  - “bow-wow” theory (based on onomatopoeia): does not explain words for silent objects or abstract concepts, assumes that language is only a list of names for things
  - “pooh-pooh” theory (based on instinctive sounds people make in emotional circumstances): these sounds are emitted in a way which differs significantly from speech (when we inhale, not when we exhale)
- __social interaction__: “yo-he-ho” (= “oh issa!”) theory (sounds used to coordinate a physical effort) (good idea, but still, what is the source of these sounds?)
- __physical adaptation__ (evolution of teeth, lips, tongue, larynx, pharynx and so on)
- __tool making__ (based on the fact that the areas of the brain and brain activity involved in complex vocalization and tool making are remarkably similar)
- __genetic__ (__innateness hypothesis__)

## Computational linguistics 

Many names for basically the same thing: 

> Computational linguistics : Linguistics = NLP : CS = speech recognition : electrical engineering	= computational psycholinguistics : psychology

Natural Language Processing differs from other data processing tasks because it requires knowledge of language. One of the main problems is the ambiguity of natural language (cf. lexical and semantic disambiguation, probabilistic parsing).

### Tasks

The objective of NLP is to make computers perform tasks involving natural language, e.g.:

- improving human-human communication
  - machine translation
- enabling human-computer communication
  - dialogue systems (aka conversational agents)
  - web-based question answering ("solved" for yes/no and factoid questions)
- performing text and/or speech processing
  - TTS (Text To Speech)
  - STT (Speech To text)
  - grammar & spell checking

### Tools

- State machines
- rule systems
- probabilistic models & machine learning
- vector-space models
- predicate & first-order logic
- classic search algorithms such as depth & breadth first search and A* search

### Chronology

- 1936: automata (Turing)
- 1943: McCulloch-Pitts neuron
- 1950: Turing test, first speech recognition systems (Bell Labs)
- 1956: CFG (Chomsky) and other formal language theory
- 1957-60: division into symbolic (formal languages + “classic” AI by McCarthy, Minsky etc.) & stochastic paradigm
  - 1966: ELIZA (Emacs’ doctor)
  - Logic Theorist (theorem prover)
  - first online corpora
- 1970s-90s: ulterior subdivision into four fields:
  - stochastic paradigm
  - logic-based paradigm (logic programming)
  - natural language understanding (1972: SHRDLU)
  - discourse modelling
- 2000+: rise of machine learning
