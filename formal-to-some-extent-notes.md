# Introduction to Formal Linguistics

- FL is only formal to some extent, so not as a binary notion linguistics. This is due to the fact that the object of study is natural language, which is ambiguous -> levels of “formalness”
- Precursors: 

  - Pāṇini (Sanskrit philologist, IV century BCE)
  - various Greek philosophers
  - XIX century: 
    - historical & diachronic perspective
    - Hermann Paul: compositionality (sentences are the sum of their parts, not quite true but useful)
  - XX century: Saussure -> Synchronic (…)
- Pioneer: __Noam Chomsky__ (mid 50s) - principal contributions:
  - Syntactic structures (using mathematical tools in language analysis)
  - Chomsky hierarchy
  

# Overview of linguistics

## Methods

- _corpus_ linguistics (= study of language as expressed in _corpora_ of "real world" text. If collected in natural context (_realia_), effectiveness improves)
- formal analysis
- experimental methods (a wide variety)
- ethno-methodology (= conversation analysis, i.e. just observe language in context, used in anthropology)

## Subfields

Main subfields:

- **Phonetics** (deals with the _production of speech sounds_)
  - articulatory -> IPA chart (phonetic alphabet)
  - acoustic (physics side of things)
- **Phonology** (is about _patterns of sounds conveying a meaning_) -> phonemes, phonological rules
- **Morphology** (= study of the different forms words have, no clear boundary with syntax, cf. compounding in German and Swedish)
  - inflectional: about different forms in a paradigm, singular VS plural, feminine vs masculine…
  - derivational: about how to create new words from existing ones (possibly in another category, e.g. adjectives from nouns)
- **Syntax/Grammar** (= set of [formally expressed, assuming that natural language is context free] structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases and words)
- **Semantics** (= study of the meaning) (uses propositional & first order logic, model theory (somehow closely related to set theory) and inference (formal & pragmatic, i.e. common sense inference)
- **Pragmatics** (= study of language _in use_): difference between what we say & what we communicate, dynamic meaning
- **Lexicon** (= inventories of words [+ idioms])

Secondary subfields:

- historical linguistics
- comparative linguistics & typology
- (…)

# Miscellaneous & my own thoughts

- > noun, verb, adjective… : types = sentence, syntagm… : composition type (similar to types & function types?)

- language differ only to some extent -> **real & statistical _language universals_**

- not so easy to define what a native speaker is
